# Cytometry-Biotechvana

Cytometry Biotechvana is a prototype of a Shiny application that allows an interactive workflow for flow cytometry data analysis. 

## Tutorial

As a Shiny based app, Cytometry Biotechvana can be hosted on a server or run locally on your machine. In this case, the R session on the machine would act as the back end, whereas the web browser would be the front end.
